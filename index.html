          <h1>American Tamaskan Description</h1>
            <p>American Tamaskans are large, athletic dogs; slightly taller in size than German Shepherds.
              With regards to build, they are substantially larger than their Siberian Husky ancestors but smaller than the American Tamaskan Adult Alaskan Malamute.
              They generally resemble grey Timber Wolves. On average, American Tamaskan adults measure around 24-28 inches tall at the shoulder and typically weigh between 55-88 pounds.
              The heaviest recorded Tamaskan males (to date) weigh just under 130 pounds.
              Females are usually slightly smaller and lighter than males, with a distinct feminine appearance.
              Males are more heavyset with broader heads and a heavier bone structure.
              Tamaskans have a lupine appearance with a straight bushy tail and thick double coat that comes in three main colors: Wolf Gray, Red Gray, and Black Gray.
              Each individual guard hair is agouti banded along its length.
              The almond-shaped eyes are yellow through amber and brown, with lighter colored eyes being very rare.
